# Christmas
A plugin I made a few months for a server called MysticMC.

You can place a Christmas tree through a schematic anywhere in the world.
There are particles around the tree to make it look cooler. 

When players vote before the 25th, it places their heads below the tree, updating constantly depending on who has voted the most. 
Then, when the day arrives, the owners of the heads that are left below the tree can claim their presents by right-clicking the head.
